## Introduction
Guardian Deploy is a server tool that deploys the newest updates from a github repo(through github webhook) into an EC2
instance.

AWS provides cloud deployment and hosting services. A common suite or product people use to continuously deploy their
code into a cloud server is using: AWS CodePipeline which listens to a source control artifact(github, bitbucket, etc),
initiates deployment and build process into services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
